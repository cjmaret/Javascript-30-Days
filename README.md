# ⏰[Javascript 30 Days Challenge!](https://cjmaret.github.io/Javascript-30-Days/)⏰

## Project Description / Functionality: 
This site is a collection of Javacsript widgets and mini-projects I built following the [JS 30 Days Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/). The projects range from creating a drum kit, to a video player, to flex image galleries, to speech recognition. Everything is built with vanilla Javascript, and was great practice to introduce myself to a lot of what Javascript can do.

## Project Technologies/Techniques:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
